# Game Development / Capstone Project Proposal

- **Name**: William Cram
- **Year and Qtr**: 7yr Qtr 1
- **Additional Teammate (If working in team)**: Solo

## Introduction:
- Provide context and motivations of the project.
    - Why did you decide to work on this project?
      - I've wanted to return to VR development for a while and a friend of mine introduced me to a framework that incorporates Javascript libraries to deploy online. After spending some time learning some of the ins and outs I've become extremely interested in creating interactive modules, both vr and web based, that can be used for interactive educational materials.
- 
    - What are your goals for this project?
      - To learn the ins and outs of AFrame and Three.js to deploy interactive educational modules in canvas.
      - Increase my knowledge of rendering, shaders, webgl, return back to blender, and increase my skills in VR.
      - Create a portfolio of material that others can interact with and see my skills in developing webgl materials.
- What do you project your final project will look like?
    - A robust selection of interactive, web based materials related to game developmemt that allow students to learn subjects in browser.

    - What are features that you would like to implement if given the time?
      - Full VR hand gesture controls
      - Touch Screen controls for mobile
      - High quality modeling ( using blender to develop models )
      - Advanced interactions between user and app
      - Animations

- (Pre-project)
    - How difficult do you think this project will be?
      - I've spent the past couple of weeks diving into these frameworks already so a large learning curve is already done. There's a lot of nuances to learn but I'm looking forward to tackling and sharing with everyone.
 
    - What skills do you plan to develop with this project that will be useful for your job search?
        - Increase knoweldge in javascript, three.js. game development, content creation, package management with node, continual depoyment with github, animation, modeling, textures, shaders, etc...

    - What is the industry like for this kind of application (such as mobile application, web development, data analysis, etc.)?
      - VR has had a resurgance with Apple VR Pro being released and Quest 3 making a large leap from Quest 2
      - Education is badly in need of a tech boost and it's been a personal goal as an instructor to implement and demonstrate a proof of concept at the increased quality of learning with apps like this
      - I've already had a lot of discussions with others in the industry about this concept and there is a LOT of excitment at the pospect of something like this.
      - Any knowledge obtained, be it success or failure, will make me more viable in the job market. Since this is a budding field I am posied to become a voice that can lead to potiential consulting positions.

## Process Overview:
- Mention tools and artifacts used, such as version control and task managers.
    - Languages
      - Javascript
      - Possibly Python
    - Frameworks
      - AFrame
      - Three.js
    - Tools
      - Blender
      - Visual Studio Code 
      - Node.js
    - Version Control
      - GitHub
    - Systems you will deploy on (VR, Web, Mobile (Specifically Mac or Windows), Cross-Platform, etc.)
      - VR
      - Web
      - PC
- Resources that you have found that you will use ( This isn't set in stone )
	- Websites
    	- https://threejs-journey.com/
    	- https://aframe.io/
    	- ChatGPT

- Explain team roles and procedures.
    - If working with someone else, what are the roles you both plan to have?
    - What features and functions will you both plan to work on?
        - This should be an equal distribution of responsibility. I will be grading per individual and if someone is pulling the weight of the other, I will grade accordingly. Also, reach out to me if this appears to be an issue.
    - All me

## Requirements:
- What are the features that you plan to implement?
    - Note: Reach out to me if you need help defining what kind of features you would like to implement, how to achieve them, and if they are robust enough for this class.
    - Note: I will reach out to you if your project needs to be expanded upon. This is meant to be a showcase of skills and something to demonstrate at an interview.
  - User Interactions
  - UI
  - Web Based Continual Deployment
  - Interactive Controls ( Drag and drop, click, VR Hand Controls,etc.. )
  - In Canvas nesting 
  - Animation
  - 3d Modeling
  - Lighting
  - Texturing
  - Shading
  - Physics
  - Ai ( Nav Mesh Agent )

## Project Timeline:
- Provide a timeline overview, possibly as a Gantt chart or sequential list of milestones.
    - **Week 0 :** Already ahead by working through the Three.js journey (TJJ) tutorial. Already done with the basics on onto the advanced course
    - **Week 1 :** Map out the goals that I want to achieve during the project and how I want my students to benefit from my knowledge by creating interactive lessons for them. Most intimidating week.
    - **Week 2 :** Work thru Chapter 2 of the TJJ course. This should conclude with an incresed knowledge of the lighting system, shadows, particles, and animated scroll ( this really excites me ). I will demonstrate knowledge in this by creating 1 to two modules for the game dev class.
    - Goal: Module to introduce basic geometry and models
    - **Week 3 :** Continue TJJ. Advanced concepts. Implement concepts.
      - Import 3d models ( already done)
      - Raycasting interactions
      - Physics
      - Environment Mapping
      - Realistic Rendering ( Unsure for a game dev module )
      - Learning how to structure larger projects
      - This would be a huge push into making interactive apps. 
      - Goal : Create a module that introduces game controls
    - **Week 4 :**  Continue TJJ.
      - Goal : Have a physics based lesson online to introduce rigid body concepts
    - **Week 5 :**
      - Start TJJ Shaders chapter, longest chapter. Get though 1 /3 rd
      - Rest Week for Class
      - Goal: Introduce materials ( textures, maps, etc... )
    - **Week 6 :**
      - Continue TJJ Shaders. Get though 1 /3 rd
      - 
    **etc...**
    

    - **Week 11 :** Demonstration
- Describe key phases and interesting details about each phase.
    - Examples for this are (Your big features)
        - Deploying On the Web ( needs continual deployment via GitHub Actions)
        - Scene Development and Interaction
        - Importing models, materials, and animation and getting them properly rigged up
        - Getting VR working
        - etc.

## Future Work:
- Discuss potential new features or improvements for future versions.
    - What are features that you would like to implement, but are beyond the 3-month mark?
      - I'd like to find a way to have persistent data using this so students can acheieve things like experience gain, badges, etc..
      - Build out further to have multiple player interactivity. Great concept for outreach
